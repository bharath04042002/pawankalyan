     [3] He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.

    As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema.
     He enjoys a huge fanbase across the Telugu states, 
     often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and akin to a "cult following."[12]
      He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in 
      Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012.[13][18] He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a

       <h1><mark>Early Life</mark></h1>
       <p>Pawan Kalyan was born as Konidala Kalyan Kumar[40] on 2 September 1971[2] 
        in a Telugu family to Konidala Venkata Rao and Anjana Devi in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh.[44][45]
         Venkata Rao worked as an excise police constable and was transferred on a regular basis.

        Kalyan was educated at St. Joseph's High School in Nellore and later in Madras (now Chennai).
        [46] In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts 
        demonstration.[27] He also holds a black belt in Karate.[26]</p><hr>
        <h1><mark>Acting career</mark></h1>
        <h3><b>1996–1997: Early work</b></h3>
        <p>Kalyan made his acting debut in 1996 with Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi directed by E. V. V. Satyanarayana.[47] 
            It was produced by Allu Aravind under Geeta Arts Banner, and co-starred Supriya Yarlagadda,
             granddaughter of Akkineni Nageswara Rao. The film employed a unique marketing campaign before its release. 
             Initially, posters featuring Kalyan were released with the question, "Who is this guy?". 
             Later, before the film's release, posters declaring "This is our Kalyan" further heightened audience interest.
             [48] Released in October 1996, the film was a moderate success at the box-office.
             [49] Kalyan’s performance and martial arts skills received significant attention.[50]</p>
             <h1><b><mark>1998–2001: Success streak and stardom</mark></b></h1>
             <p>Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by A. Karunakaran and co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva.
                 Karunakaran saw Pawan Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he was perfect
                  for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to 
                  producer G. V. G. Raju, who had worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta.[56] The film was a major hit, 
                  launching Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.[57] It won the National Film
                   Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film
                    Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Preethsu Thappenilla (2000) and in Hindi as Mujhe Kucch 
                    Kehna Hai (2001).[58]</p><hr>

            <h1>About</h1><p>The Janasena Party (transl. People's Army Party; abbr. JSP) is an Indian political party active in the states of Andhra Pradesh
                 and Telangana. Founded by Pawan Kalyan on 14 March 2014,[5][6] it is currently the second largest party in the Andhra Pradesh
                  Legislative Assembly and a partner in the ruling coalition.[7] Pawan Kalyan, the party leader, has been serving as 
                  the Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. Janasena advocates for a centrist approach with a focus
                   on humanism.[2] The party's election symbol is a glass tumbler.[8]

                Janasena did not contest the 2014 elections, but its support was crucial for the victory of the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh.
                [9] In 2017, the party brought national attention to the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam, described by the WHO as
                 "the least understood and the least publicized nephropathy".[10] In 2018, the party protested against forced land acquisition, 
                 illegal mining in reserved forests, and drought issues.[11] In 2019, JSP contested its first elections, winning one MLA seat and
                  securing about 6% of the vote share. Afterwards, it focused on grassroots issues like farmer welfare, illegal sand mining,
                   women's safety, and land encroachment. In the 2024 elections, Pawan Kalyan played a key role in allying JSP, TDP, and BJP,
                    leading to a landslide victory for the alliance. JSP won all 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats it contested, becoming part of the
                     ruling coalition.[12]</p><hr>
